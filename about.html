      <p>I'm Jaden, a computer science student at Lake Land College. I am primarily here for developing applications for desktop computers, though game development is a secondary hobby of mine that I would like to study as well. I really enjoy open-source software, and hope to contribute to a project that I enjoy someday soon.</p>
      <p>Music is a big passion of mine. I have been playing music in my school's band since 5th grade, and I have never stopped since. By 9th grade, I was starting to look into writing music of my own, and I have wrote many songs of my own in the past few years. I got my start playing the alto saxophone, and recently I have picked up the bass guitar.</p>
